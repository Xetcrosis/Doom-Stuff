## Enemy spawning

make a bool variable to see if a wave is active, if it is NOT then enable it and allow the player to spawn items by sacrificing a wave point, the more wave points you have the better items you can spawn.

every timer a player fails to kill all the monsters an extra archvile will be added to the next wave. this effect stacks.
