# Doom-Stuff

Hello! This is a git repository for my personal doom maps! I like to work on various side projects from time to time, some of those include the maps for DOOM 2 found inside this repository. Whether you are a friend of mine checking out the new map I just updated or an employer doing reaserch on me and stubbled uppon this, Welcome! At the current monent I've only created map's for DOOM 2 but if that changes I will update this page. All of the map's are created using [UDB](https://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?t=66745)

If you are confused and dont know how to play them I made a tutorial Below

## Tutorial

If you are new to DOOM and dont know how to play the map's, Thats fine as well. Below is a short guide on how to install GZDOOM (my personal prefered way to launch my maps) and load the maps I create! If you feel my explination is too hard fo follow or simply would prefer a video, there are a ton of great ones on Youtube! Check out this [GZdoom install tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWS-FKD-vrw).

First! head over to https://zdoom.org/downloads and download the latest version of GZDOOM for your specific operating system (the blue one and whatever OS ur using) and drag the file you get wherever. Next we gotta make sure you even have DOOM in the first place! The map's I publish use DOOM 2 primarily, I suggest buying DOOM 2 from an official source such as on [DOOM 2 on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2300/DOOM_II/). Next you want to unzip that folder and drag the DOOM2.WAD file from the base folder inside the folder it creates (right click DOOM2 on steam and hit brows files, go to base and the DOOM2.WAD should be there).

Then simply download whatever map you want to play and drag it over the Gzdoom.exe inside the folder you unzipped and bam! Hopefully you are now playing the latest version of my doom maps! If you run into any issues be sure to contact me though the contacts listed on my profile!
